> **Declarative JSX/TSX codemod CLI with interactive wizard, diff-preview and one-shot ‚ÄúYOLO‚Äù mode**

## ‚ú® What it does

1. **Wizard-driven spec** ‚Äì tell the tool which component you want to migrate \
   (old package(s) ‚ûú new package, named vs default import, new component name).
2. **Static analysis pass** ‚Äì scans every `*.js|jsx|ts|tsx` file, records:
   - import locations
   - every JSX element for that component
   - full prop snapshots
3. **Rich reports** ‚Äì JSON overview plus an **interactive CLI** where you can:
   - filter by package ‚ûú component
   - see frequency of each prop key / value
   - drill into duplicates tables
4. **Codemod rules** ‚Äì configure property `remove`/`set`/`rename` or
   full-snippet `replaceWith` (outer/inner placeholders handled for you).
5. **Diff preview (dry-run)** ‚Äì shows Git-style coloured patch for every file.
6. **Migration (YOLO)** ‚Äì rewrites the files in-place, updates / removes imports
   and prints a success summary.

## üöÄ Quick start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jvPalma-anchorage/jsx-migr8.git
cd jsx-migr8
yarn          # or npm install / pnpm i
```

```bash
# configure env variables
mv .env.example .env      # launches the interactive menu
code
```

```bash
# run the wizard
yarn start      # launches the interactive menu

# generate reports
# (option appears in the menu after the wizard)
# ...
```

```bash

## üó∫Ô∏è CLI flags (non-interactive)

| Flag           | Shorthand | Description                                     |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `--root <dir>` | `-r`      | Project root to scan (default: `process.cwd()`) |
| `--blacklist`  | `-b`      | Comma-separated folders to ignore               |
| `--interative` | `-i`      | Force wizard even if spec already exists        |
| `--showProps`  | `-sp`     | Jump directly to props report                   |
| `--dryRun`     | `-d`      | Print diffs but do **not** write files          |
| `--yolo`       | `-y`      | Apply migration immediately                     |

## üß© Writing rules

Rules live under `src/remap/**`. A rule can:

```ts
{
  match: [ { tag: "a", size: true } ],   // OR-array of AND-objects
  remove: ["tag", "size"],               // props to drop
  rename: { oldName: "newName" },        // map old ‚ûú new
  set: { variant: "linkStandalone" },    // add / override
  importFrom: "@old/pkg",
  importTo:   "@new/pkg",
  replaceWith: {
    INNER_PROPS: ["href","target"],
    code: `
      <Text {...OUTER_PROPS}>
        <a {...INNER_PROPS}>{CHILDREN}</a>
      </Text>`
  }
}
```

Placeholders:

| Token              | Replaced with                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `{...OUTER_PROPS}` | All surviving / new props for the _outer_ component |
| `{...INNER_PROPS}` | Sub-set of props pushed down to the inner element   |
| `{CHILDREN}`       | Original children nodes                             |

## Project overview

### Why we built it ‚Äì the never-ending **Common ‚Üí Latitude** migration

Anchorage‚Äôs front-end still contains thousands of `<Text>` and other design-system components imported from `@anchorage/common`.
Maintaining *two* DS packages forces every feature team to:

* scan huge codebases to discover what still lives in **Common**
* hand-convert dozens of subtle prop/variant changes (often by search-and-replace üò±)
* run risky ‚Äúbig-bang‚Äù PRs that break styling or behaviour

The pain is time, risk and developer frustration.

### Vision ‚Äì **jsx-migr8** to the rescue

`jsx-migr8` is a CLI that:

1. **Scans** the whole repo on every run ‚Üí an always-fresh graph of imports and JSX usage.
2. **Shows** prop statistics in a friendly table so teams can pick what matters.
3. **Generates** machine-readable migration specs (*Migr8Spec*) instead of ad-hoc scripts.
4. **Transforms & commits** code with AST-aware rules, preserving formatting and complex expressions.

Result: repeatable, reviewable, *safe* migrations that scale with the design-system roadmap.

## Milestones & tasks

Below is a Linear-ready break-down.  Each bullet is a task; indentations are sub-tasks where helpful.

### üî¨ **Proof of Concept**

| ID      | Title                                    | Goal / expected outcome                                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P-1** | Minimal AST parser spike                 | Parse a single file, list all `import` statements and corresponding JSX tags. |
| **P-2** | Na√Øve codebase scanner                   | Recursively walk a root folder, collect the above info into an in-memory map. |
| **P-3** | JSON usage report (`usage.json`)         | Persist the map so we can inspect results between runs.                       |
| **P-4** | First hard-coded remap (`Text` ‚Üí `Text`) | Transform one file in memory and print the diff to StdOut.                    |
| **P-5** | CLI wrapper (`jsx-migr8 scan`)           | Expose root-path flag, run tasks P-2 to P-4 from the terminal.                |
