# Integration Fixes Summary

This document outlines all the integration fixes applied to make the web UI, API, and CLI tool work together seamlessly.

## 1. API Integration with CLI Tool Core Functionality

### Fixed Issues:
- The API now properly integrates with the CLI tool's service registry
- Project Manager creates scoped containers with proper service configuration
- Each project gets its own isolated service container with overridden configuration

### Key Changes:
- Updated `ProjectManagerService` to use `SERVICE_TOKENS` from the CLI tool
- Fixed configuration service override in project containers
- Added proper error handling for service resolution

## 2. Fixed Missing Endpoints and Broken API Routes

### Updated API Routes:
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project (was `/api/projects/init`)
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get project details (parameter renamed from `:projectId`)
- `POST /api/projects/:id/analyze` - Analyze project (was `/api/analyze/components`)
- `POST /api/projects/:id/migrate` - Start migration (was `/api/migrate/dry-run`)
- `GET /api/migration/rules` - Get migration rules (new)
- `POST /api/migration/rules` - Create migration rule (new)
- `GET /api/migration/tasks/:taskId` - Get migration status (new)
- `GET /api/projects/:id/backups` - Get backups (new)
- `POST /api/projects/:id/backups` - Create backup (new)
- `POST /api/projects/:id/backups/:backupId/restore` - Restore backup (new)
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id/backups/:backupId` - Delete backup (new)

### Response Format Updates:
- All responses now match the frontend's expected data structures
- Project responses include `id`, `name`, `path`, `status`, and `lastModified`
- Analysis results include properly formatted component and package information

## 3. Fixed Project Preferences (rootPath) Persistence

### Implementation:
- Project configuration is stored in the `ProjectSession` object
- Each project maintains its own configuration including:
  - `rootPath` - The project directory path
  - `blacklist` - Directories to exclude
  - `includePatterns` - File patterns to include
  - `ignorePatterns` - File patterns to ignore
- Configuration is properly passed to CLI tool services through service overrides

## 4. Fixed WebSocket Connection Issues

### WebSocket Fixes:
- Added proper WebSocket path `/ws` in the server configuration
- Updated frontend WebSocket service to handle message types correctly
- Fixed subscribe/unsubscribe message format
- Added automatic reconnection with 3-second delay
- WebSocket properly integrates with Vite's proxy configuration

### Message Types Supported:
- `subscribe` - Join a project room for updates
- `unsubscribe` - Leave a project room
- `progress` - Migration progress updates
- `log` - Real-time log messages
- `complete` - Migration completion notification
- `error` - Error notifications

## 5. Ensured Scanning Workflow Works End-to-End

### Workflow Implementation:
1. User selects project directory in the Inspect page
2. API creates project with proper configuration
3. Analysis is triggered, using CLI tool's GraphService and AnalyzerService
4. Component summary is generated and converted to frontend format
5. Results include:
   - Component names, packages, and file paths
   - Props with types, required status, and usage counts
   - Component instances with real usage examples
   - Package grouping and statistics

### Progress Tracking:
- WebSocket broadcasts progress updates during analysis
- Frontend displays real-time progress indicators
- Proper error handling and status updates

## 6. Ensured Results are Properly Displayed in the UI

### UI Updates:
- Dashboard shows API and WebSocket connection status
- Inspect page properly displays:
  - Component tree grouped by package/file/component
  - Props table with usage statistics
  - Component instances with code examples
  - Export to migration rules functionality
- Dry Run page shows:
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Log streaming
  - File diff previews
- Migrate page includes:
  - Progress bars with file counts
  - Real-time log streaming
  - Success/error status indicators
  - Backup option

   WebSocket <──────────> WebSocket Server      Service Registry
   Connection               (Real-time)           (DI Container)
```

## Key Integration Points:

1. **Service Registry**: The API server initializes the CLI tool's service registry and creates scoped containers for each project
2. **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time updates flow from the API to the UI via WebSocket
3. **Data Transformation**: API controllers transform CLI tool outputs to match frontend expectations
4. **Progress Tracking**: Migration and analysis operations report progress through callbacks
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation from CLI tool through API to frontend

## Testing the Integration

To test the complete integration:

1. Start the API server: `yarn api:dev`
2. Start the web UI: `yarn web:dev`
3. Open the web UI at http://localhost:5173
4. Create a project by selecting a directory
5. Run analysis to see component inspection
6. Create or select migration rules
7. Run dry-run to preview changes
8. Execute migration with real-time progress

All components should now work together seamlessly, providing a web interface to the CLI tool's functionality.
